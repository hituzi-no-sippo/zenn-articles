[StyLua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua)はLua用のコードフォーマッターです。

**フォーマットできるコード**

- Lua
  - 5.1
  - 5.2
- [Luau](https://luau-lang.org/)
  type checkと、lintを追加したLuaの派生言語です。

parserは[full-moon](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/full-moon)を使用しています。

NeovimのLuaプラグインでよく見かける印象があります。

## 使用方法

**フォーマットする**

    # --glob '**/*' のように ' で囲む必要があります。
    stylua <path>

    # stylua ./ = stylua --glob '**/*.lua' -- ./ です。
    # globを指定せず、 <path> がdirectoryのときは、
    # globの **/*.lua にmatchするfileをフォーマットします。
    stylua --glob <pattern> -- <directory_path>

**フォーマットする部分を表示し、フォーマットはしない**

    $ stylua --check test.lua
    Diff in test.lua:
    1        |-          local a = 1
        1    |+local a = 1

**特定の行だけをフォーマットする**

    stylua --range-start <num> --range-end <num> <path>

::: message
[README](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua#finding-the-configuration)に記載はありませんでしたが、動作確認すると、次の2点も行なっていました。
- 行末までの空白などの、無駄な空白を削除する
- fileの最後(EOF)に改行文字(EOL)がないとき自動で追加する

**Code**

```lua
# < が改行位置です
print(123)                <
print(123)                -- comment<
```

**Result**

    stylua --check ./
    Diff in ./test.lua:
    1 |-print(123)
    2 |-print(123) -- comment
    1 |+print(123)
    2 |+print(123) -- comment
:::

## 設定

`stylua.toml` or `.stylua.toml` がconfig fileになります。
config fileがない場合、defaultの設定を使用します。

defaultでは、`stylua.toml` と `.stylua.toml` を検索する際、 StyLua CLIを実行したcurrent directoryしか検索しません。
[特になにもなければ、project rootにconfig fileを配置するのを推奨しています。](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua#finding-the-configuration)

:::message
READMEで使用するのを勧めていませんが、StyLua CLIに `--search-parent-directories` を追加すれば、root pathまでconfig fileを検索できます。
:::

### 設定値

* column_width
  1行の文字数の目安です。
  目安なので、1行の文字数が設定値より越える場合があります。
  120(default)
* line_endings
  使用する改行文字(EOL)です。
  Unix(`LF`) or Windows(`CRLF`)
  Unix(default)
* indent_type
  indentをspace or tabか決めます。
  Tabs or Spaces
  Tabs(default)
* indent_width
  1つのindentに対するspace数です。
  4(default)
* quote_style
  string literalに使用する引用符です。
  設定できる引用符は `'` (Single)と `"` (Double) です。
  `"\"2\""` =>  `"'2'"` のように、 stringのescapeの有無で引用符を反転する `AutoPrefer***` と、反転しない `Force***` があります。
  AutoPreferDouble(default)

* no_call_parentheses
  1つのstring、1つのtableだけを渡す関数の引数を囲む `()` を、 省略するか(`setup {}` or `setup({})`)を決めます。
  defaultは省略しません。(`setup({})`)
  false(default)

**defaultのstylua.toml**

```toml
column_width = 120
line_endings = "Unix"
indent_type = "Tabs"
indent_width = 4
quote_style = "AutoPreferDouble"
no_call_parentheses = false
```

### 無視するfile

無視するfileは `.stylaignore` で設定します。
`.gitignore` と似た書式で記載します。

## 一部のcodeだけを無視する

フォーマットしたくないcodeがある際、次の2つをcommentとして記載します。

* `stylua: ignore`
  次の1行をformatしません。
* `stylua: ignore <start|end>`
  startとendで囲んだcode blockをformatしません。

**`sylua: ignore` の使用例**

1.  フォーマットが必要なfileを作成する

```lua
          local a = 1
```

2.  checkに表示される

        $ stylua --check test.lua
        Diff in test.lua:
        1        |-          local a = 1
            1    |+local a = 1

3.  `stylua: ignore` を追加して、無視するようにする

```lua
-- stylua: ignore
          local a = 1
```

4.  checkに表示されないのを確認する

        stylua --check test.lua

        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
        modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

    become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
    distributes such Contribution.

    2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

    The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
    this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
    distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
    Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
    Contributor:

    (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
        or

    (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
        Version); or

    (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
        its Contributions.

    This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
    or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
    the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

    2.4. Subsequent Licenses

    No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
    distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
    License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
    permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

    2.5. Representation

    Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
    Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
    to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

    2.6. Fair Use

    This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
    applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
    equivalents.

    2.7. Conditions

    Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
    in Section 2.1.

    3. Responsibilities
    -------------------

    3.1. Distribution of Source Form

    All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
    Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
    the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
    Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
    License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
    attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
    Form.

    3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

    If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

    (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
        Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
        the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
        Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
        than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

    (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
        License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
        license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
        the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

    3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

    You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
    provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
    the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
    Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
    Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
    License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
    under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
    the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
    Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
    License(s).

    3.4. Notices

    You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
    (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
    or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
    the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
    the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

    3.5. Application of Additional Terms

    You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
    Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
    behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
    such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
    You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
    liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
    disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
    jurisdiction.

    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
    ---------------------------------------------------

    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
    License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
    statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
    the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
    describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
    be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
    Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
    or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
    recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

    5. Termination
    --------------

    5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
    if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
    compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
    Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
    Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
    ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
    non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
    come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
    Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
    notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
    first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
    from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
    Your receipt of the notice.

    5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
    infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
    counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
    directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
    You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
    2.1 of this License shall terminate.

    5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
    end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
    have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
    prior to termination shall survive termination.

    *  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
    *  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
    *  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
    *  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *

    ************************************************************************

    8. Litigation
    -------------

    Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
    courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
    place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
    jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
    Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
    cross-claims or counter-claims.

    9. Miscellaneous
    ----------------

    This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
    necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
    that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
    shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

    10. Versions of the License
    ---------------------------

    10.1. New Versions

    Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
    10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
