:::

**Version**
[2021/12/5](https://github.com/williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer/commit/8fab72f68391a2719b5ee7b399789d33e0a2d416)

**[nvim-lsp-installer](https://github.com/williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer)とは**
Language Server Protocol(LSP)のserverをinstall,uninstallするNeovim用のpluginです。

:::message
明記しない場合、serverとはLanguage Server Protocolのserverを指し示します。
:::

**特徴**
-   簡単にserverをinstallできる
    `LspInstall <server_name>` or `LspInstallInfo` で `i` keyを押す
-   serverのversionを選択できる
    e.g. `LspInstall rust_analyzer@nightly`
-   [LSP server](https://github.com/williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer/blob/main/CUSTOM_SERVERS.md)を追加できる
-   serverの起動時間を早める最適化ができる
-   Windowsのfull support

[対応しているserverを知りたい人は、公式のREADMEを見てください。](https://github.com/williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer#available-lsps)

## Commands

* LspInstallInfo
installしているserverや、installできるserverをfloating windowで表示します。
serverのinstall, uninstall, updateもできます。
`?` keyを押せば、keymapのhelpを表示します。

:::

* LspInstall \[--sync\] &lt;server\_name&gt;  
serverを(re)installします。
serverは `<server_name>` で選択します。
`--sync` を引数に渡したときはblocking方式でinstallし、
installが終わるまで何もできません。
`--sync` はscriptだけで使用するのを推奨しています。READMEに記載がありました。
* LspUninstall \[--sync\] &lt;server\_name&gt;  
serverをuninstallします。
他は `LspInstall` と同じです。
* LspUninstall \[--no-confirm\]  
Installしているserverを全てuninstallします。
`--no-confirm` を引数に渡すと `(Y)es/(N)o` の確認をしません。

defaultのserverのinstall先は `stdpath("data")` になります。
`LspInstallInfo` でserverのinstall先を見られます。

:::message alert
installしただけでは、serverは動きません。
`setup()` functionを使用して、LSPのsetupをする必要があります。
:::

* LspInstallLog  
log fileを開きます。
tabを生成し、そこに開きます。
* LspPrintInstalled  
installした全てのserverを表示します。

## Setup

**installしたserver全てを対象にしたsetup**

```lua
local lsp_installer = require("nvim-lsp-installer")

-- installしているserverの起動準備をします。
-- `server` に格納しているのはServer classで、
-- server nameやsetup functionを含んでいます。
lsp_installer.on_server_ready(function(server)
  local opts = {}

  -- `sumneko_lua` をinstallしているなら `hello world` を表示します。
  if server.name == 'sumneko_lua' then
    print('hello world')
  end

  -- serverに対応しているfiletypeのbufferを開いたら、
  -- 実行するfunctionを設定します。
  -- sumneko_luaはluaのLSP serverなので、
  -- luaのbufferを開いたら、実行するfunctionです。
  opts.on_attach = function(client,buffer_number)
    print(vim.inspect(client))
    print(buffer_number)
  end

  -- LSPのsetupをします。
  -- setupをしないとserverは動作しません。
  server:setup(opts)
end)
```    

:::message

`on_server_ready` をしなくても、serverを動かせます。

**これでもserverは動きます。**

```lua
local lsp_installer = require("nvim-lsp-installer")

-- installしているserverのdictを取得します。
local servers = lsp_installer.get_installed_servers()
-- serversの値はServer Classなので `setup` を実行できます。
servers[1]:setup({})
```

[`on_server_ready` のcode](https://github.com/williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer/blob/8fab72f68391a2719b5ee7b399789d33e0a2d416/lua/nvim-lsp-installer.lua#L215-L223)を読みましたが、
何をもって準備完了としているのか分かりませんでした。
:::
**特定のserverを対象にしたsetup**

```lua
local lsp_installer_servers = require'nvim-lsp-installer.servers'

local name = 'sumneko_lua'
-- server_available
-- nvim-lsp-installerが対応しているserverかをbooleanで格納しています。
-- requested_server
-- serverが対応している場合、そのserverのLSPのdefault configが含まれている
-- Server class(`help nvim-lsp-installer.server`)を格納しています。
local server_available, requested_server = lsp_installer_servers.get_server(name)

-- nvim-lsp-installerに対応していないserverだったら、
-- error messageを表示して終了します。
if not server_available then
  error(string.format("nvim-lsp-installer doesn't support %s server.", name))
  return
end

requested_server:on_ready(function ()
  local opts = {}
  -- LSPのsetupをします。
  requested_server:setup(opts)
end)
-- serverがinstallされていない場合、そのserverをinstallします。
if not requested_server:is_installed() then
  requested_server:install()
end
```

## `LspInstallInfo` のiconsとkeymap config

installしているserverや、installできるserverを表示する
`LspInstallInfo` のUIのconfig方法です。

**`LspInstallInfo` のUIのconfig(値はdefaultの値)**

```lua
local lsp_installer = require("nvim-lsp-installer")

lsp_installer.settings({
  ui = {
    icons = {
      -- installされたserverのicon
      server_installed = '◍',
      -- install待ちserverのicon
      server_pending = '◍',
      -- installしていないserverのicon
      server_uninstalled = '◍',
    },
    keymaps = {
      -- cursorのserverの詳細を表示するkey
      toggle_server_expand = '<CR>',
      -- cursorのserverをinstallするkey
      install_server = 'i',
      -- cursorのserverをupdateするkey
      update_server = 'u',
      -- cursorのserverをuninstallするkey
      uninstall_server = 'x',
    },
  },
})
```

:::message
[2021/12/14の時点では、helpとUIを閉じるkeyを変更できません。](https://github.com/williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer/blob/0fe8c254d90794f13860cbeac5e5987a081a8031/lua/nvim-lsp-installer/ui/status-win/init.lua#L9-L11)
:::

## Install Config

**installのconfig(値はdefaultの値)**

```lua
local lsp_installer = require("nvim-lsp-installer")
local path = require("nvim-lsp-installer.path")

lsp_installer.settings({
  -- install先のroot directory
  install_root_dir = path.concat { vim.fn.stdpath "data", "lsp_servers" },
  pip = {
      -- `pip install` に渡す引数
      -- 必要ない引数を渡すことは推奨されていません。
      -- 動作に影響を与える可能性が高いからです。
      -- e.g. `{ "--proxy", "https://proxyserver" }`
      install_args = {},
  },
  -- log level
  -- installに問題がありdebugする際、`vim.log.levels.DEBUG` にすると便利です。
  log_level = vim.log.levels.INFO,
  -- 同時にinstallできるserverの最大数
  max_concurrent_installers = 4,
})
```
